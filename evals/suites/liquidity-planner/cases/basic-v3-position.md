# Basic V3 Concentrated Liquidity Position

I want to provide liquidity for the ETH/USDC pool on Ethereum with $5,000. Help me set up a V3 concentrated liquidity position.

## Context

- The user wants to create a Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity position
- Token pair: ETH/USDC on Ethereum mainnet
- Amount: $5,000 equivalent
- They need guidance on price range selection

## Requirements

1. Look up the current ETH/USDC pool price
2. Suggest an appropriate price range based on current market conditions
3. Explain the trade-offs of narrow vs wide ranges
4. Generate a Uniswap deep link with the position parameters pre-filled
5. Include fee tier recommendation

## Expected Output

A response that checks current pool state, suggests a price range with rationale, recommends a fee tier, and generates a working Uniswap deep link for creating the V3 position.
