# LP Planning Completeness Rubric

Evaluate whether the response provides a complete liquidity provisioning workflow.

## Expected Elements (Should Include)

Score based on how many of these are present:

1. **Token Verification**
   - Verifies token contracts on the target chain
   - Uses DexScreener or on-chain data to confirm token existence

2. **Pool State Analysis**
   - Checks current pool price or liquidity
   - Provides context for the user's decision-making

3. **Version Comparison**
   - Explains the differences between the chosen version and alternatives
   - Helps the user understand why they might choose V2 vs V3 vs V4

4. **Risk Communication**
   - Mentions impermanent loss or other LP-specific risks
   - Provides realistic expectations for the position

5. **Actionable Deep Link**
   - Generates a working Uniswap deep link
   - Displays the link prominently for the user to access

## Penalties (Should Not Include)

Deduct points for:
- Generating a link without verifying tokens (-0.1)
- Using wrong version parameters (e.g., price range for V2) (-0.15)
- Ignoring the specified chain (-0.1)

## Scoring Guide

Base score from expected elements:
- 5/5 elements: 1.0
- 4/5 elements: 0.85
- 3/5 elements: 0.65
- 2/5 elements: 0.5
- 1/5 elements: 0.3
- 0/5 elements: 0.0

Then subtract any penalties.

## Instructions

Count the expected elements present, then apply any penalties. The response should enable informed LP decisions with a clear path to execution.
