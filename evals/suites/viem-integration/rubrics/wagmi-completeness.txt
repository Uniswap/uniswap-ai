# Completeness Rubric for wagmi React Integration

Evaluate whether the generated output includes all expected elements for a wagmi React application.

## Expected Elements (Should Include)

Score based on how many of these are present:

1. **Documentation**
   - Has inline comments explaining key steps
   - Includes package installation instructions

2. **State Handling**
   - Handles wallet connection states (connecting, connected, disconnected)
   - Handles loading and error states for contract reads

3. **Best Practices**
   - Uses chain constants from wagmi/chains
   - Uses parsedAbi or typed ABIs for contract reads
   - Properly wraps components in required providers

4. **Maintainability**
   - Code is readable and well-structured
   - Components follow single-responsibility principle

5. **Completeness**
   - Includes all necessary imports
   - Example is runnable without modification (except env vars like WalletConnect project ID)

## Penalties (Should Not Include)

Deduct points for:
- Using deprecated wagmi APIs (-0.1)
- Hardcoding private keys in code (-0.15)
- Using ethers.js instead of wagmi/viem (-0.15)

## Scoring Guide

Base score from expected elements:
- 5/5 elements: 1.0
- 4/5 elements: 0.85
- 3/5 elements: 0.65
- 2/5 elements: 0.5
- 1/5 elements: 0.3
- 0/5 elements: 0.0

Then subtract any penalties.
