# Completeness Rubric for viem-integration

Evaluate whether the generated output includes all expected elements and follows viem best practices.

## Expected Elements (Should Include)

Score based on how many of these are present:

1. **Documentation**
   - Has inline comments explaining key steps
   - Includes package installation instructions if applicable

2. **Error Handling**
   - Handles RPC errors gracefully
   - Handles contract revert cases

3. **Best Practices**
   - Uses simulateContract before writeContract
   - Uses parseAbi or typed ABIs instead of raw ABI arrays
   - Uses chain constants from viem/chains

4. **Maintainability**
   - Code is readable and well-structured
   - Variables are descriptively named

5. **Completeness**
   - Includes all necessary imports
   - Example is runnable without modification (except env vars)

## Penalties (Should Not Include)

Deduct points for:
- Using deprecated viem APIs (-0.1)
- Hardcoding private keys in code (-0.15)
- Missing await on async operations (-0.1)

## Scoring Guide

Base score from expected elements:
- 5/5 elements: 1.0
- 4/5 elements: 0.85
- 3/5 elements: 0.65
- 2/5 elements: 0.5
- 1/5 elements: 0.3
- 0/5 elements: 0.0

Then subtract any penalties.

## Instructions

Count the expected elements present, then apply any penalties for issues found. Provide the final score.
