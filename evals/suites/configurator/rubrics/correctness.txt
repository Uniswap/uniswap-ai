# Correctness Rubric for CCA Configurator

Evaluate whether the generated configuration correctly implements CCA auction parameters.

## Required Elements (Must Include)

Score based on how many of these are correctly implemented:

1. **Q96 Price Calculation**
   - Uses Q96 = 2^96 (79228162514264337593543950336) as base value
   - Correctly accounts for decimal differences between token and currency
   - For USDC (6 decimals) with 18-decimal token: divides by 10^12

2. **Tick Spacing and Floor Price Alignment**
   - Tick spacing calculated as percentage of floor price
   - Floor price rounded DOWN to be evenly divisible by tick spacing
   - Verification: roundedFloorPrice % tickSpacing == 0

3. **Supply Schedule**
   - Schedule sums to exactly 10,000,000 MPS total
   - Block durations decrease over time (convex curve property)
   - Final block contains approximately 30% of supply
   - Each step releases approximately equal token amounts

4. **Block Configuration**
   - Correct block time for network (2s for Base)
   - Valid block sequence: startBlock < endBlock <= claimBlock
   - Auction duration matches requested timeframe

5. **Configuration JSON Structure**
   - All AuctionParameters fields present
   - Valid Ethereum addresses (42 chars starting with 0x)
   - Correct data types for all fields
