# Token Discovery Completeness Rubric

Evaluate whether the response provides a complete token discovery workflow.

## Expected Elements (Should Include)

Score based on how many of these are present:

1. **Data Provider Usage**
   - Uses DexScreener API or similar data provider to find tokens
   - Searches by relevant criteria (chain, category, trending)

2. **Token Metrics**
   - Shows price information for discovered tokens
   - Shows 24h trading volume
   - Shows liquidity depth

3. **Risk Awareness**
   - Mentions the risks of trading memecoins or low-liquidity tokens
   - Recommends caution or due diligence
   - Does not blindly recommend any token

4. **Token Verification**
   - Verifies discovered token contracts on-chain
   - Checks that tokens trade on Uniswap (not just any DEX)

5. **Actionable Output**
   - Offers to generate a Uniswap deep link for the user's chosen token
   - Provides enough information for the user to make an informed decision

## Penalties (Should Not Include)

Deduct points for:
- Recommending a specific token without data (-0.15)
- Presenting unverified contract addresses (-0.1)
- Ignoring the specified chain (-0.1)

## Scoring Guide

Base score from expected elements:
- 5/5 elements: 1.0
- 4/5 elements: 0.85
- 3/5 elements: 0.65
- 2/5 elements: 0.5
- 1/5 elements: 0.3
- 0/5 elements: 0.0

Then subtract any penalties.

## Instructions

Count the expected elements present, then apply any penalties for issues found. The response should enable informed token discovery, not just list random tokens.
